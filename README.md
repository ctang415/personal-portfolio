Creating this portfolio website was a great way for me to play around with CSS animations and transitions. I generally do not like adding too much to a website, so I tried to keep the special effects to a minimum. I tend to favor simplistic aesthetics and opted for basic transitions such as including a loading screen where the text loads in and gradually fades out until the website finally appears. I also learned how to create a carousel to showcase my projects better, adding a sliding effect to the carousel buttons as users click through the catalog for a smooth transition.

I really wanted to add an animated background to spice up the plain black and white themes from Material UI, but I couldn't figure out how to create the proper effect that I had envisioned. I wanted a rotating image that was positioned at the corner of the page with varying gradient noise that could blend in seamlessly with the solid backgrounds so that the animation wouldn't be too disruptive for the eyes. I only managed to create a pulsating effect for the background by changing the image size within the animation keyframe, but I didn't like how there wasn't much variation within it.
